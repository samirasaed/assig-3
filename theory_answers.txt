MiniShell – Theory Answers
==========================

1. What is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.

2. Role of fork(), exec(), wait():
fork() creates child processes.
exec() runs a program in the child process.
wait() makes the parent wait for the child to finish.

3. Lex & Yacc:
Lex = lexical analyzer
Yacc = parser generator

4. Command execution:
Shell parses input → fork() → execvp() → parent waits

5. Built-in commands: cd, exit

6. Pipes:
Output of one command → input of another

7. I/O Redirection:
Use file descriptors to read/write files instead of terminal

8. Challenges:
Parsing, process management, file descriptors, resource leaks
